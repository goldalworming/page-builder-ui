# Page Builder UI

This is a very basic browser-based drag and drop page builder UI, built with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vue Draggable](https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable).

I built this simply as a learning exercise, and this code should not be considered production-ready, nor is it an example of any kind of best practice.
